# For [tt-rss](http://tt-rss.org): Open 10 shown starred articles in background tabs and unstar them**

It simplifies this workflow: On a mobile tt-rss reader, I star articles which I want to read on my desktop 
later. On the desktop, I need to click each one of them and un-star, which is annoying.

# Installation

```
cd .../tt-rss/plugins.local
git clone https://bitbucket.org/wolfgang/tt-rss-plugin-openten.git openten
```

If your browser settings prevent opening new windows/popups, openten will stop and warn you.

# Update

```
cd .../tt-rss/plugins.local/openten
git pull origin master
```
